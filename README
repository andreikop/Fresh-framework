	Build and install the library.

1. Enter fresh directory.
2. Run 'qmake'
3. Run 'make'
4. Run 'make install'. Command requires root privileges.

	Build and install Python bindings
1. Build the library
2. Enter 'build' directory:
	cd <path of fresh directory>
3. Configure:
		python ../Python/configure.py
   NOTE: Script tries to detect PyQt4 installation directory automatically, but, 
   detected path was incorrect for me (hlamer) on Ubuntu 10.04.
   So, I was need to set it manually. For me, command was:
		python ../Python/configure.py -d /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.6/PyQt4/
4. Build:
		make
5. Install
		make install
	Command requires root privileges.
6. Try to import installed module
		python -c 'import PyQt4.fresh'
	No any traces mean module installed and imported correctly
